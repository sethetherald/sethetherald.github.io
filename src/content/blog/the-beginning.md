### Introduction
#### Hello!

If you stumble upon this page without visiting the [main page][1] first, I highly recommend that you do.

Anyhow, I'm a mere computer science major, and this blog here is for me to rant about stuff, mostly about software and the like, as well as documenting my thoughts.

### The website

I did not build this website from scratch at all. I simply fork the source code from my [friend's page][2], change some content, add a workflow to deploy to Github page, and behold: a website!

### The struggles

Since I didn't know anything about Astro, as well as being a noob with Git-related stuff, I encountered a lot of problems, ranging from [creating a pull request in that friend's repo][3], to spending 2 hours trying to figure out how Github Action won't build the damn project already (I just needed to specify the package manager in Astro action).

#### Was that scuff?
Yes. 
#### Was it worth it?
Yeah, kind of, for the experience.

### The conclusion

In the end, it took me roughly 5 hours to get the website up and running, but it was quite a satisfying experience because I learned something new.

### The plan going forward

As you can see, this website is currently being hosted on Github, with a Github-provided domain.

Since I'm still broke at the moment, custom domain or self-hosting is out of the picture. However, I will do my best to achieve either one of those two objectives, or both of them in the future.
